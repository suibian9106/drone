MAV_CMD_DO_RETURN_PATH_START (188) — [WIP]
WORK IN PROGRESS: Do not use in stable production environments (it may change).

Mission item to specify the start of a failsafe/landing return-path segment (the end of the segment is the next MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START item).

A vehicle that is using missions for landing (e.g. in a return mode) will join the mission on the closest path of the return-path segment (instead of MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START or the nearest waypoint). The main use case is to minimize the failsafe flight path in corridor missions, where the inbound/outbound paths are constrained (by geofences) to the same particular path. The MAV_CMD_NAV_RETURN_PATH_START would be placed at the start of the return path. If a failsafe occurs on the outbound path the vehicle will move to the nearest point on the return path (which is parallel for this kind of mission), effectively turning round and following the shortest path to landing. If a failsafe occurs on the inbound path the vehicle is already on the return segment and will continue to landing. The Latitude/Longitude/Altitude are optional, and may be set to 0 if not needed. If specified, the item defines the waypoint at which the return segment starts. If sent using as a command, the vehicle will perform a mission landing (using the land segment if defined) or reject the command if mission landings are not supported, or no mission landing is defined. When used as a command any position information in the command is ignored.

MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START (189)
Mission item to mark the start of a mission landing pattern, or a command to land with a mission landing pattern.

When used in a mission, this is a marker for the start of a sequence of mission items that represent a landing pattern. It should be followed by a navigation item that defines the first waypoint of the landing sequence. The start marker positional params are used only for selecting what landing pattern to use if several are defined in the mission (the selected pattern will be the one with the marker position that is closest to the vehicle when a landing is commanded). If the marker item position has zero-values for latitude, longitude, and altitude, then landing pattern selection is instead based on the position of the first waypoint in the landing sequence.

When sent as a command it triggers a landing using a mission landing pattern. The location parameters are not used in this case, and should be set to 0.

MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MISSION_CURRENT (224)
Set the mission item with sequence number seq as the current item and emit MISSION_CURRENT (whether or not the mission number changed). If a mission is currently being executed, the system will continue to this new mission item on the shortest path, skipping any intermediate mission items. Note that mission jump repeat counters are not reset unless param2 is set (see MAV_CMD_DO_JUMP param2).

This command may trigger a mission state-machine change on some systems: for example from MISSION_STATE_NOT_STARTED or MISSION_STATE_PAUSED to MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE. If the system is in mission mode, on those systems this command might therefore start, restart or resume the mission. If the system is not in mission mode this command must not trigger a switch to mission mode.

The mission may be "reset" using param2. Resetting sets jump counters to initial values (to reset counters without changing the current mission item set the param1 to -1). Resetting also explicitly changes a mission state of MISSION_STATE_COMPLETE to MISSION_STATE_PAUSED or MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE, potentially allowing it to resume when it is (next) in a mission mode.

The command will ACK with MAV_RESULT_FAILED if the sequence number is out of range (including if there is no mission item).

Param (Label)	Description	Values
1 (Number)	Mission sequence value to set. -1 for the current mission item (use to reset mission without changing current mission item).	min: -1 inc: 1

MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE (2000)
Start image capture sequence. CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED must be emitted after each capture.

Param1 (id) may be used to specify the target camera: 0: all cameras, 1 to 6: autopilot-connected cameras, 7-255: MAVLink camera component ID. It is needed in order to target specific cameras connected to the autopilot, or specific sensors in a multi-sensor camera (neither of which have a distinct MAVLink component ID). It is also needed to specify the target camera in missions.

When used in a mission, an autopilot should execute the MAV_CMD for a specified local camera (param1 = 1-6), or resend it as a command if it is intended for a MAVLink camera (param1 = 7 - 255), setting the command's target_component as the param1 value (and setting param1 in the command to zero). If the param1 is 0 the autopilot should do both.

When sent in a command the target MAVLink address is set using target_component. If addressed specifically to an autopilot: param1 should be used in the same way as it is for missions (though command should NACK with MAV_RESULT_DENIED if a specified local camera does not exist). If addressed to a MAVLink camera, param 1 can be used to address all cameras (0), or to separately address 1 to 7 individual sensors. Other values should be NACKed with MAV_RESULT_DENIED. If the command is broadcast (target_component is 0) then param 1 should be set to 0 (any other value should be NACKED with MAV_RESULT_DENIED). An autopilot would trigger any local cameras and forward the command to all channels.

The sender should wrap this time back to zero based on required timing accuracy for the application and the limitations of a 32 bit float. For example, wrapping at 10 hours would give approximately 1ms accuracy. Recipient must handle time wrap in any timing jitter correction applied to this field. Wrap rollover time should not be at not more than 250 seconds, which would give approximately 10 microsecond accuracy.	s
2 (processing_time)	The time spent in processing the sensor data that is the basis for this position. The recipient can use this to improve time alignment of the data. Set to zero if not known.	s
3 (accuracy)	estimated one standard deviation accuracy of the measurement. Set to NaN if not known.	
4	Empty	
5 (Latitude)	Latitude	
6 (Longitude)	Longitude	
7 (Altitude)	Altitude, not used. Should be sent as NaN. May be supported in a future version of this message.	m
